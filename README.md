# Statecord 🚀
**StateCord** is software for **Discord** that automatically updates your RPC.
The developing StateCord can be installed as a plugin for projects such as BetterDiscord in the future.
Using StateCord software is not like software that gives more than 100 options :laughing:
Using the user-friendly StateCord is **soooooo simple**.
